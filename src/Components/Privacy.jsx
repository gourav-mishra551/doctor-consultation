                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Request access</span> to your personal data that we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request” or DSAR).

                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Request correction</span> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected. We will need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Request erasure</span> of your personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Object to processing</span> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third-party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Request restriction</span> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Request the transfer</span> of your personal data to you or to a third-party. We will provide to you, or a third-party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                <p className='text-gray-500 font-normal'> <span className='text-gray-700 font-semibold'>Withdraw consent</span> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.

If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
