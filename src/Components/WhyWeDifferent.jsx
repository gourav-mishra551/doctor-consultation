            <p className='font-normal'>ametheushealth.com was born out of a desire to do things differently. We saw how traditional pharmacies were selling online and felt that we could create a much simpler, easier process that puts patients at the centre of the care and better care sometimes means fewer medicines, not more.</p>
            <p className='font-normal'>We provide medicines from India and Europe. Back office operation is supported from India only for the audience of CIS, Middle-East, Asia and African countries. If clients are buying from USA/EU then the delivery will be as per guideline of EU/USA drug policy.</p>
